Diodes' medium voltage DC-DC high brightness LED drivers combine a small footprint and high power density with operating voltage Hi Reddit, I'm self taught in electronics and as such there's some gaps in my knowledge. I'm currently building a specialised dim red torch for my friends for use with astrophotography, using the zxsc310 led driver. I've already built a functioning prototype but I'd like the ability to switch between two brightness modes as it's too bright currently (with a simple 20ma red led), perhaps with a switch that brings a different sense resistor into the circuit (I'll use a DPDT switch to also ensur.

The LT1932 is a fixed frequency step-up DC/DC converter designed to operate as a constant-current source. Because it directly regulates output current, the LT1932 is ideal for driving light emitting diodes (LEDs) whose light intensity is proportional to the current passing through Hi! I'm building a controller for a led light for my terrarium. Planning to use Meanwell ldd dc-dc drivers. The light is a 20W strip that the manufacturer supplies with a 24V power brick (that I hopefully can avoid buying). For power supply I'm wondering if I can somehow use a Dell 19.5V, 12,3A power brick that I have lying around. Only issue is that to drive the led strip at the power I want, I need at least 27V input to the Meanwell driver (needs to be 3V higher than the max output).

Build your own high quality LED lights using name brand parts at an affordable price. Minimal knowledge required Hey guys already built my space tote, and I'm looking to build a more classic bucket using a LED chip/cob. Just need to make sure I understand a few things first. If I'm running a 100w Led chip, it's better to run it at 50w correct? A lot of the LED chips I'm able to get in NZ don't list amps. So if I'm correct, to find the amps I divide the voltage with the wattage. So 50w / 34v =1.47amps. Also is the reason you want to run them at lower wattage because you get more hours Драйвер led dc-dc lm2596. Понижающий преобразователь напряжения dc.

I'm boxing up (metal case) a DMX driver board ( with 4 x 12V 3A PWM outputs and would appreciate your thoughts on a suitable DC input connector; ideally I'd like it to be panel mount; like a 2.5mm DC jack - but I can only find good quality ones rated for 7.5A max and the total current through the unit could be up to around 12A plus the board's load (a few hundred mA). That is a realistic load as in a couple of weeks I'll be driving

I have a 100W led with a step up transformer that I set to 33V. So power supply 12V and Input to the led needs to be right at 33V. From what I have been reading I need a constant current led driver. The 100W led max current is 3500mah, so 3.5A. My problem is that I can't find an led driver that meet all my criteria. Or maybe I'm coming at this wrong. I CAN find AC drivers but I need DC. Any recommendations welcome.

I have an existing 120v wall dimmer switch, and I'd like it to control a 12v LED strip. The whole strip only pulls a maximum of 20 watts, and will only limited at 80% brightness, so I found this 24 watt driver ( My problem is where to mount it, though.

Manufacturer of electronic power supply converters such as AC/DC and DC/DC converters, switching regulators and LED drivers for use in a wide variety of applications and in a power range from 0.25W Hi guys! I build a pretty simple dc-dc boost converter for driving a led strip and for some reason when under heavy load the switching mosfet gets hot to the point of melting the solder. It's rated for 30V 3.2A and I'm giving it max 5V 2A. Is it boiling because I should have chosen a fet with a higher amp rating or because I didn't tie the gate to ground through a resistor? schematics ( Edit: I'm switching the transistor at 62KHz, which I know is maybe not enough

AC DC LED Drivers power supplies. High power, reliable solution Before discovering Paul Carmody's Isetta, I had found the Tangband W5-1138SMF woofer on my own while perusing the selection at Parts Express while looking for subwoofers that would work in a small box. There were some interesting 3½" and 6" woofers, but ultimately the W5-1138SMF came out on top while comparing the simulations. Later when I saw mention of the Isetta, I recognized the woofer from my previous exercise and decided I wanted to build my own version. I already had four Peerless PLS-TP.

I found a direct wire conversion j box that accepts romex and then has 18 gauge wires inside that you splice into the romex. Is this safe? My driver is 120ac to 24v dc and has 18 gauge wires as well. If I wire the 18 gauge ac wires to 12 or 14 gauge would this cause heat issues? The circuits are 20 and 15 amps that I’m using. Do they make an in-line fuse that takes 12/14 gauge romex and 18 gauge on the other side? Honestly if I’m using low voltage LED strips I can’t find an option that works. AC- DC 12V Outdoor Waterproof Transformer Power Supply Adapter LED Light Driver. I'd like to understand how necessary a separate, constant voltage (current?) driver/adapter is for LEDs such as LEDs mounted on tape.
